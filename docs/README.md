## Who Is This For?
- Doctors and nurses who want a simple way to assess patient risk

## How Does It Work?
Right now, the app runs entirely in your browser—no backend or server is required! All data is stored locally on your device for privacy and ease of use.

## Try It Out (Frontend Only)
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Open a terminal and run these commands:
